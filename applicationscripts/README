Any application specific requirements can be implemented here. The application type is configured as one of the first options
of the build process on the build client. For example, the wordpress application you can see here corresponds to the
NUOCIALBOSS-WORDPRESS application choice at build time. When you choose an application type, its application specific scripts
will be run.
